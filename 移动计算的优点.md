# 移动计算的优点



## What is the advantages of mobile commputing?

There are several advantages of mobile computing, including:

1. Portability: Mobile computing devices are small and lightweight, making them easy to carry around.

2. Increased productivity: Mobile computing allows users to work from anywhere, which can increase productivity.

3. Connectivity: Mobile computing devices are designed to connect to wireless networks, which allows users to stay connected to the internet and access important information.

4. Real-time data access: Mobile computing allows users to access real-time data, which can be useful in making important business decisions.

5. Cost-effective: Mobile computing devices are often less expensive than traditional desktop computers and laptops.

6. Increased collaboration: Mobile computing devices allow users to collaborate in real-time, no matter where they are located.

7. Personalization: Mobile computing devices can be customized with a range of applications and tools, allowing for a personalized experience.

## Compared with cloud computing using centralized server, what are the benefits of mobile computing?


Compared to cloud computing using a centralized server, mobile computing has several benefits, including:

1. Flexibility and Mobility - Mobile computing allows users to access data and applications from anywhere, without the need for a centralized server.

2. Low Latency - Since data processing is done locally on the mobile device, there is lower latency compared to cloud computing.

3. Increased Security - Mobile computing allows for greater control and security of sensitive or confidential data, as it is not stored on a centralized server.

4. Improved In-Network Computing - Mobile devices have the capability of performing computation within the network, instead of sending all data to a centralized server.

5. Cost-effective - Mobile devices are often less expensive to maintain than a centralized server, which can be expensive to purchase, install and maintain.

6. Increased Performance - Mobile devices have improved hardware and software capabilities, which can improve overall computing performance.

Overall, mobile computing offers more flexibility, mobility, and security compared to cloud computing using traditional centralized servers.
