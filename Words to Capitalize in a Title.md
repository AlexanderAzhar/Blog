# Words to Capitalize in a Title
When using title case, which words in a title or headline should be capitalized, and which words should not be capitalized? The short answer is:

- Capitalize the first word and all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives
- Lowercase all articles, (short) prepositions, and certain conjunctions 

This is a simplified representation of the title case rules; the detailed rules for various styles can be found on the dedicated page Title Capitalization Rules.
However, if you are not sure what a “subordinating conjunction” is or if you already have a specific word in mind that you want to check, then this is the right page for you. It features an alphabetical list of words that are of special interest for title case capitalization, for example, because they are often capitalized incorrectly, are capitalized differently depending on their grammatical function, or are capitalized differently depending on the style guide that is used.
In the light blue box below, select the style you are interested in (e.g., AP style or Chicago style), or select multiple styles to compare them. The table will then specify for each word whether it should be capitalized or lowercased for the selected style(s). Sometimes this depends on the grammatical function of the word (“out,” for example, is lowercased as a preposition, but capitalized as an adverb or adjective). In such a case, the provided examples will help you identify the function (and thus, the correct capitalization) of the word in your title.
The first word of a title or subtitle and (except for AMA, APA and Bluebook style) the last word are always capitalized. This is a universal rule and thus not repeated throughout the table. If a word is not listed in the table, then it must be capitalized (unless it is the second part of a Latin species name).
