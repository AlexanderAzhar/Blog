# Title Capitalization Rules
There are two basic styles for the capitalization of titles and headlines, sentence case and title case.
In sentence case, the first word and all proper nouns and proper adjectives are capitalized. All other words are lowercased (just like in a regular English sentence): Bank of America is missing out on Wall Street’s boom
In title case, the first word (and usually the last word) is capitalized, as well as all major words. Minor words are lowercased: Bank of America Is Missing Out on Wall Street’s Boom
However, there is no universal convention which words in a title are major and which are minor. Rather, there are various style guides which each have their own rules regarding title case. This page describes the title case rules of eight common style guides: the AMA Manual of Style, the AP Stylebook, the APA Publication Manual, the Bluebook, the Chicago Manual of Style, the MLA Handbook, the New York Times Manual of Style and Usage, and the Wikipedia Manual of Style. Also featured is a table with a comparison of these styles.
A different approach to title case can be found on the page Words to Capitalize in a Title, which specifies the correct capitalization for individual words. And, of course, the Title Case Converter offers a fully automatic conversion to title case, applying the rules of the style of your choice.
