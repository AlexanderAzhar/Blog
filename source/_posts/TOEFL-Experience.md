# TOEFL Experience

**For My Brother Guang Yang**

The process or result of learning is never a thing that can be calculated through an exact meter, but preparing for the exams has its own way that we can sometime apply to get good grades. Here are some of my experience on how to get decent scores in TOEFOL.

<br>

1. Recite 20 to 100 TOEFL words everyday. 
   Remember 2 things:
   (1) Review of the past words are more important than reciting the new ones; 
   (2) Never ignore those words that looks familiar to you. Try to recite the familiar word's all meanings and exampled cases.
2. Try to do a real exam practice first. You can download some applications or directly practice online. 
   Remember 2 things: 
   (1) Use the REAL OLD EXAMS, not the simulations, to measure your current ability, then you will find out your deficiencies and problems so that you're able to solve them. 
   (2) Always try to make yourself in a real exam situation when you are taking the test. If you can't, just try to make an atmosphere like that! For example, you can take your simulation test in a noisy classroom with people going in and out. Yeah, the real situation is somewhat noisy and people will go in and out from the exam hall, you have to be fully focused on your own exam and avoid those distractions.
3. Practice more! Always practice upon the TOEFL exam itself. DO NOT PRACTICE ANY OTHER THINGS THAT CAN SEEMS UNRELATED WITH THE EXAM ITSELF. (For example: listening to English songs, watching English films, speaking with foreigners online etc.) Note that the TOEFL is a test of your comprehensive ability rather than the test of your real foreign communication ability. 
4. Always catch your mistakes and just calm down to think about the reason why you have mistaken, practice more.
5. Practice your speed! You should be clarified that the exam time is not enough, especially for your reading test. You can't read thoroughly through all the details of a passage, so you have to view the current question first and then find out the answer for it. Time control is significant while doing the TOEFL reading test.
6. When it comes to the preparation of the listening test, find some ways to enhance your note-taking ability. Interpretation note taking methods are listed below in `Appendix II` for a reference from my point of view, but you may find some more suitable methods to enhance your ability.

7. While practicing your speaking ability, you have to link your speaking ability with the listening practice. Never separate them! Try to speak loudly so that your voice can be recorded by the microphone clearly. You can record your own voice while you are practicing.
8. Essay is important and you have to read some tutorials related to the TOEFL Essay Test and practice with those guides. Some of the mottos or sayings of the famous people is strongly recommended. Some of them is listed below in `Appendix I`.
9. Do at least 5 real-test-based simulation test before entering the exam day.
10. Sleep well before the exam day.
11. Eat well in the morning on the exam day.
