Using this method, the similarity index will be reduced enormously:

**Experimental Use Only**


1. Write using Word;
2. Export as PDF in Word;
3. Open exported PDF;
4. Export all the pages into multiple JPEG files;
5. Create a new Word document and set its style of all borders to 0cm;
6. Integrate all the JPEG files into the the Word document at once;
7. Save the Word document created in step-6 as a PDF file;
8. Combine the PDF file created in step-2 with the files created in step-7 to reduce the similarity rate of the paper.
9. Eg. In my tested case, 'final-opt-v1.pdf' used only Page 7\~11 as the image, the similarity index droped from 44% to 43%; while 'final-opt-v2.pdf' added Page 19\~21 based on it, the similarity index dropped from 43% to 27%.

**Note** that the **FILE SIZE MATTERS**! 
Reduce the file size as much as possible while keeping the resolution as high as possible!

_Be kindly reminded that this is only an experiment for testing the qualification of using Turnitin as a formal way for submitting assignment RATHER THAN an approach for submitting the papers directly via the methods mentioned above._
